# Introduction #

Well, my name is Bart Enkelaar, I'm a junior software developer at TOPdesk, the Netherlands.

As I slowly increase the size of my baby steps through software development wonderland Roel brought me along on this SPI project. Now I'm trying hard to make myself useful.

I too work for TOPdesk on a Service Management Tool
